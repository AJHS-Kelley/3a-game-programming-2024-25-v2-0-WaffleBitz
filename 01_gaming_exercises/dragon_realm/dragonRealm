# STEP 1 -- Create the file name to use.
log_file_name = "dragon_realm_log" + str(time.time()) + ".txt"
# log_file_name = "dragon_realm_log"
# Example: dragon_realm_log1132AM.txt

# STEP 2 -- Create / Open the file to save data.
save_data = open(log_file_name, "x")
# FILE MODES
# "x" CREATES FILE, IF EXISTS, EXIT WITH ERROR MESSAGE
# "w" CREATES FILE, IF EXISTS, ERASE AND OVERWRITE FILE CONTENTS
# "a" CREATES FILE, IF EXISTS, APPEND DATA TO THE FILE
